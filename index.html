          This D3 donut chart is utilized in order to graph the distribution of
          the points collected by each F1 Drivers depending on the driver's
          total career points. We were able to make each slice clickable by
          implementing a few fundamental D3 routines, and doing so will bring
          the points corresponds to that particular slice. Users can find it
          much simpler and more convenient to compare the F1 drivers total
          collected points when using donut charts since each of the slices have
          their own unique lengths, yet they all have the same width.

          In the line graph, each data point is depicted as a single segment of
          a straight line. The F1 drivers average positions in their career are
          shown along the x-axis, while the statistics of their rankings are
          presented along the y-axis. The line graph is better at displaying
          data over time and visually illustrating changes that take place
          throughout the F1 Drivers career. The Line graph shows the data in
          intervals, making it easier for readers to identify trends.
